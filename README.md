## üîß Configuration Files

| File Path | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` | Main NGINX configuration file. |
| `/etc/nginx/conf.d/` | Directory for site or service-specific config files. |
| `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` | Site definitions (not active by default). |
| `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/` | Symlinks to active site configurations. |
| `/etc/nginx/mime.types` | MIME type mappings. |

> On many distributions, only `nginx.conf` and `conf.d/` are used by default. The `sites-*` structure is popular in Ubuntu but not standard in all systems.
